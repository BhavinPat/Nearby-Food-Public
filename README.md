# Nearby Food 
## Overview

- Note: Please read the LICENSE in the LICENSE Folder. This app or any app created with inspiration from this app may not be distributed on any App Store or used for commercial purposes without the expressed permission of Bhavin Patel. Who can be contacted at bbaspatel@icloud.com. This app is for learning purposes.
- Note: Running this app as is will fail. You need two things. A free Firebase account and a free yelp API key. Once you obtain a API key you can add that to the API-Key.swift file. Once you create a firebase account you will need to create a iOS project and download the GoogleService-Info.plist file and add it to this app bundle. Rememeber that the bundle identifier for both the Firebase project and the Xcode project must be the same. Copy the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID(in the downloaded plist file) to Target-> Info-> URL Types-> URL Schemes. The URL Type you should use is aleady created one. There will be tutorials made by me on how to do this. I will post a link here once I make them. 
 
## Description
There are hundreds of restaurants near you. Let Nearby Food help you find them! 

Nearby Food's helps you find the perfect restaurant or food joint you're in the mood for. Whether you're looking for something cheap and affordable or some classy with a lot of 5-star reviews Nearby Food's has got it for you. 

What about a late-night snack but too tired to cook? Nearby Food will find restaurants open near you at any time and also fit any other preferences you may have. 

Say you and your group want to all eat at different cuisines of food. Instead of arguing, pull out the Nearby Food app. You can filter food categories based on distance, price, food category type, and hours! 

Feeling adventurous? It's time to explore new restaurants you may have never heard of (never know it can become your next favorite restaurant). Nearby Food can give you random restaurants to near you. 

Uh oh. Don't know what you're in the mood for? Well, that's fine we've got you covered. Scroll through a bunch of food categories and places to eat near you. Maybe something will strike your eye and you'll never be lost again. 

What about seeing other users' favorite restaurants? Nearby Food lets you see how many people love the place you're viewing. Maybe you'll love it too???? Perhaps no one liked it so far. Well, that's fine you can give the first heart. 

Ahh now you found a place you want to try but you're stuck at work. Well, let's not lose hope! Press the Try Me Button. And the place will save and you can view the restaurant in the Try Me tab. Once you tried it out give it the heart to show the world that the place is worth trying out.

Wait! How do I get there? When you're viewing a place on the map, there's a BIG BLUE Arrow. Click it. Find out what happens. Bon App√©tit.


Nearby Food's may not work in all countries or locations. The businesses near you are based on your location and yelp.com database. Please check yelp.com for a list of supported regions. 

## Why? 
This app was orginally made to go on the Apple App Store but the launch had to be cancelled becuase as a individual developer I was unable to finance the Yelp Enterprice License. So I decided to make this into a learning a opportunity for anyone who wants to learn swift and app creation. Over the course of a year I will be uploading tutorials to medium.com. These tutorials will explain Nearby Food's code in depth. I will also add these tutorials links to the GitHub page and update the GitHub Repo with the most updated version.

## Author Note:
I hope that everyone who wants to put an app on the App Store can. This app took me over a year to make. And while the result wasn't what I expected I hope that I inspire others to attempt to create amazing products. No feat is to big for any one person. I believe that you don't need huge teams to create huge products. 

I challenge all of you to make this project better. Maybe convert it to SwiftUI, or add more features. 

If you like the work please donate to me.
